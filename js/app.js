//named my function mathematics and stated it involves my two variables, integer1 and integer2.
function mathematics(integer1,integer2){
    console.log(((integer1+integer2)*5)); // used BEDMAS to make the function add the two arguments together and multiply by 5.
}
//created my two arguments, this works with any numbers as I have tested it multiple times.

var integer1=8;
var integer2=50;

mathematics(integer1,integer2); //since it automatially prints the result I just have to state the function.
